## bundle-sync marker misclassifies un-applied unverified files as `local` on the next run

Found 2026-09-25 during `portable-skill-installation` S3 manual verification (pre-existing,
unrelated to that pitch's scope). `bundle-sync.js`'s marker write snapshots the full CURRENT
source manifest as the next `base`, regardless of which files were actually applied. A file
reported `unverified` (no known base, kept, not applied) then reads as `local` ("kept, upstream
unchanged") on the next sync, even though upstream did change and the target never received it —
silently hiding a real, still-pending upstream change. Likely fix: the marker's base for a given
file should be the base it was ACTUALLY compared/kept against this run (old base if kept as
`unverified`/`local`/`conflict`, new source hash only if applied), not a blanket re-snapshot of
current source. See `.project/pitches/portable-skill-installation/log.md` (S3 observation) for
the exact repro.

## TOCTOU: ancestor-symlink race between resolveFile's check and the later write

Found 2026-09-25 during `portable-skill-installation` audit cycle 1 (security-reviewer,
deferred should-fix). `skill-registry.js`'s `resolveFile` lstats every path component once and
returns a plain string; the actual write happens afterward with no re-check. A second local
process with write access to the same project directory could in theory swap an ancestor
directory (e.g. `.project/skills/`) for a symlink in the window between the check and the write,
redirecting an install/reconcile write outside the intended tree. Not reachable from malicious
upstream skill content alone (symlinks inside fetched content are already rejected before this
point) — requires an independent local attacker already capable of racing filesystem operations
on the same host, a materially stronger precondition than this tool's actual threat model.
Deferred rather than fixed: `.project/pitches/portable-skill-installation/audit-cycle-1.md` has
the full reasoning. Candidate fix if ever prioritized: verify device/inode of the opened file
descriptor against a fresh `lstatSync` of the resolved path before trusting a write.
